   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following values. You can use `.env.dist` file :

   ```bash

```

## Environment Variables

Make sure to set up the following environment variables in your `.env` file. You can use 
`.env.dist` file:


## Running the Application

Once you've set up the environment variables, you can run the project locally or using Docker.

### Running Locally

1. **Start the MongoDB instance** (if not using Docker):

   ```bash
   mongod
   ```

2. **Start the app:**

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

The application will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Running with Docker

If you'd prefer to use Docker, follow the steps below:

1. **Build and run the containers:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Running Tests

The project includes a full test suite written with Mocha, Chai, and Supertest.

To run the tests:

```bash
npm test
```

## Docker Usage

The Docker configuration consists of two services: `backend` and `mongo`.

### Docker Services

1. **MongoDB Service**  
   The `mongo` service runs a MongoDB instance with username and password authentication. Data is persisted in a local volume `./data/db`.

2. **Backend Service**  
   The `backend` service runs the Node.js application.

### Useful Docker Commands

- **Start containers:**

  ```bash
  docker-compose up
  ```

- **Stop containers:**

  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  ```

- **Rebuild containers:**

  ```bash
  docker-compose up --build
  ```

- **Run tests in Docker:**

  ```bash
  docker-compose run test
  ```
